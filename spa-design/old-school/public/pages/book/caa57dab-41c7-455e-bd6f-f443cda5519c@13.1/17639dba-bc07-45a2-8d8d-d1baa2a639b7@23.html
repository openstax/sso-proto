</h3>
<p id="eip-203">
<em data-effect="italics">Prealgebra</em> is designed to meet scope and sequence requirements for a one-semester prealgebra course. The text introduces the fundamental concepts of algebra while addressing the needs of students with diverse backgrounds and learning styles. Each topic builds upon previously developed material to demonstrate the cohesiveness and structure of mathematics.</p>
<p id="eip-373">Students who are taking <em data-effect="italics">Basic Mathematics</em> and <em data-effect="italics">Prealgebra</em> classes in college present a unique set of challenges. Many students in these classes have been unsuccessful in their prior math classes. They may think they know some math, but their core knowledge is full of holes. Furthermore, these students need to learn much more than the course content. They need to learn study skills, time management, and how to deal with math anxiety. Some students lack basic reading and arithmetic skills. The organization of <em data-effect="italics">Prealgebra</em> makes it easy to adapt the book to suit a variety of course syllabi.</p></section><section data-depth="1" id="eip-386"><h3 data-type="title">Coverage and Scope</h3>
<p id="eip-974"><em data-effect="italics">Prealgebra</em> follows a nontraditional approach in its presentation of content. The beginning, in particular, is presented as a sequence of small steps so that students gain confidence in their ability to succeed in the course. The order of topics was carefully planned to emphasize the logical progression throughout the course and to facilitate a thorough understanding of each concept. As new ideas are presented, they are explicitly related to previous topics.
</p>
<ul id="eip-992">
<li>
<strong data-effect="bold">Chapter 1: Whole Numbers</strong><div data-type="newline"><br></div>
<p id="eip-id1166102478472">Each of the four basic operations with whole numbers—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—is modeled and explained. As each operation is covered, discussions of algebraic notation and operation signs, translation of algebraic expressions into word phrases, and the use the operation in applications are included.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong data-effect="bold">Chapter 2: The Language of Algebra</strong><div data-type="newline"><br></div>
<p id="eip-id1164699857258">Mathematical vocabulary as it applies to the whole numbers is presented. The use of variables, which distinguishes algebra from arithmetic, is introduced early in the chapter, and the development of and practice with arithmetic concepts use variables as well as numeric expressions. In addition, the difference between expressions and equations is discussed, word problems are introduced, and the process for solving one-step equations is modeled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong data-effect="bold">Chapter 3: Integers</strong><div data-type="newline"><br></div>
<p id="eip-id1164686725741">While introducing the basic operations with negative numbers, students continue to practice simplifying, evaluating, and translating algebraic expressions. The Division Property of Equality is introduced and used to solve one-step equations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong data-effect="bold">Chapter 4: Fractions</strong><div data-type="newline"><br></div>
<p id="eip-id1164699787880">Fraction circles and bars are used to help make fractions real and to develop operations on them. Students continue simplifying and evaluating algebraic expressions with fractions, and learn to use the Multiplication Property of Equality to solve equations involving fractions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong data-effect="bold">Chapter 5: Decimals</strong><div data-type="newline"><br></div>
<p id="eip-id1164691071563">Basic operations with decimals are presented, as well as methods for converting fractions to decimals and vice versa. Averages and probability, unit rates and unit prices, and square roots are included to provide opportunities to use and round decimals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong data-effect="bold">Chapter 6: Percents</strong><div data-type="newline"><br></div>
<p id="eip-id1164693485022">Conversions among percents, fractions, and decimals are explored. Applications of percent include calculating sales tax, commission, and simple interest. Proportions and solving percent equations as proportions are addressed as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong data-effect="bold">Chapter 7: The Properties of Real Numbers</strong><div data-type="newline"><br></div>
<p id="eip-id1164689451233">The properties of real numbers are introduced and applied as a culmination of the work done thus far, and to prepare students for the upcoming chapters on equations, polynomials, and graphing. </p>
</li>
<li>
<strong data-effect="bold">Chapter 8: Solving Linear Equations</strong><div data-type="newline"><br></div>
<p id="eip-id1164688355072">A gradual build-up to solving multi-step equations is presented. Problems involve solving equations with constants on both sides, variables on both sides, variables and constants on both sides, and fraction and decimal coefficients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong data-effect="bold">Chapter 9: Math Models and Geometry</strong><div data-type="newline"><br></div>
<p id="eip-id1164701002884">The chapter begins with opportunities to solve “traditional” number, coin, and mixture problems. Geometry sections cover the properties of triangles, rectangles, trapezoids, circles, irregular figures, the Pythagorean Theorem, and volumes and surface areas of solids. Distance-rate-time problems and formulas are included as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong data-effect="bold">Chapter 10: Polynomials</strong><div data-type="newline"><br></div>
<p id="eip-id1164689142386">Adding and subtracting polynomials is presented as an extension of prior work on combining like terms. Integer exponents are defined and then applied to scientific notation. The chapter concludes with a brief introduction to factoring polynomials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong data-effect="bold">Chapter 11: Graphs</strong><div data-type="newline"><br></div>
<p id="eip-id1164689681900">This chapter is placed last so that all of the algebra with one variable is completed before working with linear equations in two variables. Examples progress from plotting points to graphing lines by making a table of solutions to an equation. Properties of vertical and horizontal lines and intercepts are included. Graphing linear equations at the end of the course gives students a good opportunity to review evaluating expressions and solving equations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="eip-178">All chapters are broken down into multiple sections, the titles of which can be viewed in the Table of Contents.</p></section><section data-depth="1" id="eip-709"><h3 data-type="title">Accuracy of Content</h3>
<p id="eip-410">
We have taken great pains to ensure the validity and accuracy of this text. Each chapter’s manuscript underwent rounds of review and revision by a panel of active instructors. Then, prior to publication, a separate team of experts checked all text, examples, and graphics for mathematical accuracy. A third team of experts was responsible for the accuracy of the Answer Key, dutifully re-working every solution to eradicate any lingering errors. Finally, the editorial team conducted a multi-round post-production review to ensure the integrity of the content in its final form. 
</p></section><section data-depth="1" id="eip-421"><h3 data-type="title">Pedagogical Foundation and Features</h3>
<section data-depth="2" id="eip-515"><h4 data-type="title"><em data-effect="italics">Learning Objectives</em></h4>
<p id="eip-74">Each chapter is divided into multiple sections (or modules), each of which is organized around a set of learning objectives. The learning objectives are listed explicitly at the beginning of each section and are the focal point of every instructional element.
</p></section><section data-depth="2" id="eip-23"><h4 data-type="title"><em data-effect="italics">Narrative text</em></h4>
<p id="eip-999">
Narrative text is used to introduce key concepts, terms, and definitions, to provide real-world context, and to provide transitions between topics and examples. An informal voice was used to make the content accessible to students. 
</p>
<p id="eip-id1164700077484">Throughout this book, we rely on a few basic conventions to highlight the most important ideas:</p>
<div data-type="newline"><br></div>
<ul id="eip-369">
<li>Key terms are boldfaced, typically when first introduced and/or when formally defined.</li>
<li>Key concepts and definitions are called out in a blue box for easy reference.</li>
</ul>
</section><section data-depth="2" id="eip-132"><h4 data-type="title"><em data-effect="italics">Examples</em></h4>
<p id="eip-550">
Each learning objective is supported by one or more worked examples, which demonstrate the problem-solving approaches that students must master. Typically, we include multiple Examples for each learning objective in order to model different approaches to the same type of problem, or to introduce similar problems of increasing complexity. 
</p>
<p id="eip-id1169918306040">All Examples follow a simple two- or three-part format. First, we pose a problem or question. Next, we demonstrate the Solution, spelling out the steps along the way. Finally (for select Examples), we show students how to check the solution. Most examples are written in a two-column format, with explanation on the left and math on the right to mimic the way that instructors “talk through” examples as they write on the board in class.</p></section><section data-depth="2" id="eip-498"><h4 data-type="title"><em data-effect="italics">Figures</em></h4>
<p id="eip-25"><em data-effect="italics">Prealgebra </em>contains many figures and illustrations. Art throughout the text adheres to a clear, understated style, drawing the eye to the most important information in each figure while minimizing visual distractions. 
</p>
<span data-type="media" id="dogpic" data-alt="Prealgebra Figure">
    <img src="https://archive.cnx.org/resources/195b8c9285d30e2bbe3abef49d098d63e68f8fd6/CNX_BMath_Figure_02_03_002.jpg" data-media-type="image/jpeg" alt="Prealgebra Figure">
  </span>
</section><section data-depth="2" id="eip-422"><h4 data-type="title"><em data-effect="italics">Supporting Features</em></h4>
<p id="eip-938">
Four small but important features serve to support Examples:
</p>
<p id="eip-445"><span data-type="title">Be Prepared!</span>Each section, beginning with Section 1.2, starts with a few “Be Prepared!” exercises so that students can determine if they have mastered the prerequisite skills for the section. Reference is made to specific Examples from previous sections so students who need further review can easily find explanations. Answers to these exercises can be found in the supplemental resources that accompany this title. </p>
<p id="eip-9"><span data-type="title">How To</span></p>
<span data-type="media" id="eip-id11708242101" data-alt="how-to">
       
  <img src="https://archive.cnx.org/resources/2a016f29631cf73d810ef1e4ab5a6b6ae20c310f/howtoicon.png" data-media-type="image/png" alt="how-to">
         
</span><p>

A “How To” is a list of steps necessary to solve a certain type of problem. A "How To" typically precedes an Example.   </p>
<p id="eip-395"><span data-type="title">Try It</span></p>
<span data-type="media" id="eip-id11714388" data-alt="try-it">

    </span><p>     

A “Try It” exercise immediately follows an Example, providing the student with an immediate opportunity to solve a similar problem.  In the web view version of the text, students can click an Answer link directly below the question to check their understanding.  In the PDF, answers to the Try It exercises are located in the Answer Key.</p>
<p id="eip-434"><span data-type="title">Media</span></p>
<span data-type="media" id="eip-id1176044388" data-alt="try-it">

</span><p>



The “Media” icon appears at the conclusion of each section, just prior to the Section Exercises. This icon marks a list of links to online video tutorials that reinforce the concepts and skills introduced in the section. </p>
<p id="eip-975">Disclaimer: While we have selected tutorials that closely align to our learning objectives, we did not produce these tutorials, nor were they specifically produced or tailored to accompany <em data-effect="italics">Prealgebra</em>. </p></section><section data-depth="2" id="eip-534"><h4 data-type="title"><em data-effect="italics">Section Exercises</em></h4>
<p id="eip-528">
